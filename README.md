# ZentrixLabs.FalconSdk

A lightweight, MIT-licensed .NET 9 SDK for querying CrowdStrike Falcon data using their OAuth2 API.

> This SDK is designed to simplify local telemetry analysis, patch readiness, and device visibility by abstracting Falcon's token and device API interactions.

---

## ✨ Features

✅ Supports:
- OAuth2 token generation from API keys  
- Device query API (`/devices/queries/devices/v1`)  
- Device detail API (`/devices/entities/devices/v2`)  

🚧 Not yet implemented:
- Streaming detections or real-time event subscriptions  
- Threat Graph, incidents, or host group mutations  
- SDK-wide retry logic or circuit breakers  
- Structured logging or metrics

---

## 🛠 Requirements

You need:
- A CrowdStrike Falcon API key with the following permissions:
  - **Hosts: Read**
  - **Host Groups: Read**

From the Falcon console:
- Go to **Support > API Clients and Keys**
- Create a new key and grant the above permissions

---

## 🔐 Example: Basic Usage

```csharp
var options = new CrowdStrikeOptions
{
    ClientId = "your-client-id",
    ClientSecret = "your-client-secret"
};

var auth = new CrowdStrikeAuthService(options);
var token = await auth.GetTokenAsync();

var deviceService = new CrowdStrikeDeviceService(auth);
var deviceIds = await deviceService.GetDeviceIdsAsync();
var devices = await deviceService.GetDeviceDetailsAsync(deviceIds);
